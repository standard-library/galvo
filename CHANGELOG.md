# CHANGELOG

# 0.2.1

* Don't emit any values from resulting streams if collection is empty.

# 0.2.0

* Skip duplicate values emitted from `currentIndex`. This should prevent the `current` and `previous` property streams from being the same collection member at any time.

# 0.1.3

* Fix wrapping index in reverse

# 0.1.0

* Initial feature set
